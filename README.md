# music-profile-express-app

This test will build a personality profile chart based on your data collected from Spotify. The test itself is built on the research performed at Heriot-Watt University. 36,518 people from around the world took part in the study, by far the most extensive study of musical preference and personality ever undertaken. The research found that strong personality attributes are linked to our choices in music and our liking for a certain musical style.
